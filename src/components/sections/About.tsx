        I’m a <span className="text-white">developer</span> who loves making apps that are not just <span className="text-white">functional</span> but also fun and easy to use. I’m all about turning ideas into something cool and <span className="text-white">interactive</span>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I’m always exploring <span className="text-white">tech trends</span>, trying new tools, and keeping up with what’s fresh in tech. I enjoy a good <span className="text-white">challenge</span>; it keeps things exciting!

        When I’m not coding, I’m in the pool, sweating it out at the gym, picking up new things to <span className="text-white">learn</span>, or just chilling at home. Oh, and I absolutely <span className="text-white">love cats</span>; they make everything better!
