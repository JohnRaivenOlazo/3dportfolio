      <p className="mb-4">
        I’m a full-stack developer who loves creating apps that are not only <span className="text-gray-200">functional</span> but also fun and user-friendly. I love transforming ideas into engaging, <span className="text-gray-200">interactive</span> experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I actively explore <span className="text-gray-200">tech trends</span>, try out different tools, and stay informed about the latest <span className="text-gray-200">innovations</span> that can solve real-world problems. I thrive on challenges—they keep me motivated and make every project exciting!

      <p className="mb-4">
        When I’m not coding, you’ll find me <span className="text-gray-200">swimming</span>, working out at the gym, learning new <span className="text-gray-200">skills</span>, or just relaxing at home. And of course, I <span className="text-gray-200">love cats</span>—they make everything better!
